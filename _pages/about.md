Hi! I’m **Yaxi Luo**, a passionate researcher and software engineer with experience in:

- 🧠 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 💬 Natural Language Processing
- 🏥 AI for Healthcare

My work focuses on making AI tools more practical, trustworthy, and impactful, especially in clinical and biomedical contexts. I enjoy combining deep learning with real-world applications and have contributed to projects involving ChatGPT for clinical decision-making and fine-tuning LLMs for seizure localization.
